This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You will need to signup to dockerhub:
https://hub.docker.com/signup
Make a new account (unless you already have an account)

You will need to install docker locally:
https://www.docker.com/get-started/
Click Download button
Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the prompts
Once installed, open Docker.
click signin button and use dockerhub username/password.

Start prisma docker image:
Open a terminal and navigate to this project directory
run command: docker-compose up
This will download the correct docker images and start up a docker instance for prisma & mysql.
You will need to make sure this is started every time you want to run the project, otherwise there will be no database available to store

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
